## zen of angular

Angular is built around the belief that declarative code is better than imperative when it comes to building UIs and wiring software components together, while imperative code is excellent for expressing business logic.

* It is a very good idea to decouple DOM manipulation from app logic. This dramatically improves the testability of the code.
* It is a really, really good idea to regard app testing as equal in importance to app writing. Testing difficulty is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured.
* It is an excellent idea to decouple the client side of an app from the server side. This allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides.
* It is very helpful indeed if the framework guides developers through the entire journey of building an app: from designing the UI, through writing the business logic, to testing.
* It is always good to make common tasks trivial and difficult tasks possible.

angular frees you from the following pains:

* register callbacks
* manipulating html dom programmatically
* marshaling data to and from the ui
* writing tons of intialization code to just get start
