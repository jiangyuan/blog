`Dependency Injection (DI)` is a software design pattern that deals with how objects and functions get created and how they get a hold of their dependencies. Everything within Angular (directives, filters, controllers, services, ...) is created and wired using dependency injection. **Within Angular, the DI container is called the "injector"**.
